Task: Assessment

I am no python expert, but I did what I could with one of the most important disciplines of development: Google-fu
I only focused on the actual endpoints and didnt venture into creating an author, then blog post, then delete author or
other more complex tests as i already spent a good chunk of time getting up to speed.

Easiest way to run this would be to pull this project up in the terminal and execute:

>python -m unittest discover

Future improvements:
One of the wrappers didnt conform to the others and should be updated to return the response.
Split out the helper methods into their own class
Clean up some duplicated code
